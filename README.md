The code begins by importing the tkinter library, which is essential for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), and the strftime function from the time module to format the current time as a string. It then creates the main application window using tk.Tk() and sets its title to "DIGITAL CLOCK". The core functionality is encapsulated in the time function, which uses strftime to get the current time and date formatted as "Hour:Minute
AM/PM \n Month/Day/Year". This formatted string is then used to update the text of a Label widget, which is styled with a specific font, size, background color, and text color. The label.after(1000, time) call within the time function ensures that this function is called again after 1000 milliseconds (1 second), creating a continuous update loop for the clock. The label is placed in the center of the main window using the pack method. Finally, the time function is initially called to start the clock, and root.mainloop() is invoked to start the main event loop of the application, allowing it to run and update the time continuously until the window is closed.
